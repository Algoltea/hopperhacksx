# HopperHelps

## Inspiration
Being a student, it's easy to get caught up in your work. Deadlines and expectations can eat up a lot of your focus, but it's important to remember that your journey is far more than a checklist of assignments. Taking the time to pause and reflect is an invaluable opportunity to reconnect with your feelings and rediscover your passions.

## What it does
HopperHelps is a daily journaling app with a cute and supportive AI companion, Hopper!
Hopper makes journaling feel like less of a chore and more like a chat with a supportive friend.
Users log their daily journal entries, and Hopper offers feedback and encouragement. Sentiment analysis is used to detect and log the user's mood for that day, so it also serves as a way to see patterns in your day-to-day mood at a glance.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
Delegating tasks was difficult for us to do at the beginning of development. We have worked as solo devs for most of our time learning CS, so figuring out build a project from multiple angles at once and meet in the middle had a bit of a learning curve for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Developing as part of a group is something we have not done much of before.
We have all been long familiar with GitHub, but dealing with merge conflicts and push/pull requests is something we had little experience with before working on this project. Developing HopperHelps together has been an invaluable learning experience for us.
We have also become far more comfortable using the OpenAI models and Vercel SDKs.

## What's next for HopperHelps
The next step for HopperHelps would be to expand upon the Hopper AI companion, allowing it to give feedback on long term patterns over the course of many days; remembering things about the user and learning how to better interpret their journal entries.
The UI element for Hopper could be expanded to be more engaging, with a wider range of emotions it can visually display and animations as they change.
