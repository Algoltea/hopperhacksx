# HopperHelps

## Inspiration
Being a student, it's easy to get caught up in your work. Deadlines and expectations can eat up a lot of your focus, but it's important to remember that your journey is far more than a checklist of assignments. Taking the time to pause and reflect is an invaluable opportunity to reconnect with your feelings and rediscover your passions.

## What it does
HopperHelps is a daily journaling app with a cute and supportive AI companion, Hopper!
Hopper makes journaling feel like less of a chore and more like a chat with a supportive friend.
Users log their daily journal entries, and Hopper offers feedback and encouragement. Sentiment analysis is used to detect and log the user's mood for that day, so it also serves as a way to see patterns in your day-to-day mood at a glance.
